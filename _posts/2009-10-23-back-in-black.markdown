**Drivemeup**, a beginning of an already long story...

This adventure began during a friendly poker party almost 3 years ago.  
Back there we were just a group of student friends looking for an end of studies project.
We wanted to find a useful project which could help everyone.  
After severals brainstormings we didn't find a way to bring peace on earth (we really tried but it's kind of hard...) but we thought that carpooling was a good start.

So we started to think and build a carpooling website which would gather people in a strong community.
That's why we add it a social layer, the possibility to create events, groups, inviting his friends,...  
After few months of intense development and a growing addiction to coffee... the first prototype was born!
Bugs, a navigation not very clear, a contestable design, in short a mess but the idea was there!  
We attracted some users but the site was too soft to convince and our lack of experience was one of the principal reason.

Today, after many experiments in the .com  world, an installed addiction to coffee  well, we're back ! (not in black).
We've been following developments in the carpooling and carsharing communities very closely, looking for new and smarter ways to build stuff and we decided to build a new Drivemeup, not a prototype anymore.  
Our new roadmap is as easy as that : **Keep it simple !**  
We already began the development few weeks ago, we prepared an action plan and are working hard on a new version.  

**We'll be launching in 2010.**

We have a lot more to share as well. If you'd like to stay connected to what's happening with Drivemeup, you can subscribe to this blog's feed, follow us on Twitter, or sign up for a preview and we'll let you know as soon as it's ready.
